# Payment Processor

This is my submission for a Coding Challenge for a Company _that shall not be named_.

The project is a simple payments engine that

- reads a series of transactions from a CSV,
- updates client accounts,
- handles disputes and chargebacks and
- outputs the state of clients accounts as a CSV.

## How To Build

`cargo build`

## How To Test

`cargo test`

## How To Run

`cargo run -- test.csv > accounts.csv`

Where `test.csv` is your input file and `accounts.csv` is your output file.

## Whom Are You Gonna Call

### Possible Typos

I have a hard time spelling things correctly, so if you ever see "CVS" anywhere in this project I really mean "CSV". Sorry about it.
